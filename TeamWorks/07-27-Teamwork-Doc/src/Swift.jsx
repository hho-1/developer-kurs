/* What is Swift?

Swift is a modern, general-purpose and multi-paradigm programming language designed by Apple to build their iOS-powered devices and all the following ecosystem. Apps can be designed to run also on macOS (for Apple computers), watchOS (AppleWatch), tvOS (Apple TV digital media player), and, what may be a bit surprising z/OS, that is powering IBM Mainframe computers.
 
The language is currently distributed on Apache License, which makes it available for the community to use. It’s a relatively new project, launched in June 2014, seven years after the first iPhone’s launch.  
What is React Native?

React Native is a Facebook-supported framework designed to build device-agnostic mobile applications. Contrary to native apps that use different programming languages for each platform, React Native is based on JavaScript and allows users to share the code between various platforms, including Android, iOS, and web apps. Up to 70% of the code may be shared between the apps, significantly reducing the development time in cross-platform mobile app development. */

/* componentDidMount() metodu, bileşen zaten DOM'a (Document Object Model) yerleştirildiğinde React kodunu çalıştırmamızı sağlar. Bu metot, React Yaşam Döngüsünün Mounting aşamasında, yani bileşen render edildikten sonra çağrılır.

Tüm AJAX istekleri ve DOM veya durum güncellemeleri componentDidMount() metot bloğunda kodlanmalıdır. Tüm önemli abonelikleri burada da ayarlayabiliriz, ancak herhangi bir performans sorunundan kaçınmak için, componentWillUnmount() yönteminde aboneliklerini iptal etmeyi her zaman unutmayın. */
